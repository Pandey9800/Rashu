                <p>
                    In recent years, a continuous interest has been focused on the development of formulations using multiparticulate systems in pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, offering various advantages over single dosage forms. These advantages include improved bioavailability, easy administration for elderly people and for children. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These systems offer a flexibility of blending different release profiles, reproducible gastric residence time, low risk of dose dumping, and low risk of high local drug concentration in the gastrointestinal tract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nutraceuticals coated pellets are so flexible that they can fill in a capsule or be compressed into tablets. Commercially, there are three most accepted pelletization technologies: suspension/solution loading, powder loading, and extrusion-spheronization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a successful pellet coating process using the production capacity Wurster for concentrated nutraceutical coatings on starter pellets as well as in beadlet forms like ashwagandha, curcumin, fenugreek extract, and so on.
